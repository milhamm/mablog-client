If it makes sense to be customizable, Tailwind lets you customize it. This includes colors, border sizes, font weights, spacing utilities, breakpoints, shadows, and tons more.
</h1>

Tailwind is written in PostCSS and configured in JavaScript, which means you have the full power of a real programming language at your fingertips.

Tailwind is more than a CSS framework, it's an engine for creating design systems.
